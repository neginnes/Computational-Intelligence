# Computational Intelligence
This repo contains the project of the course "computational intelligence", instructed by Dr. Sepideh Hajipour. 
Here is a brief discription for each forlder:

The project purpose is to solve a BCI problem using pattern recognition on an EEG data and has two major phases: 
## [Phase1](./phase1/)
This phase of the project includes Feature extraction, Feature selection and Classification using neural networks (MLP,RBF).

## [Phase2](./phase2/)
This phase of the project includes Feature extraction, Feature selection and Classification using
1. [genetic algorithm (GA)](./phase2/GA/)
2. [Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)](./phase2/PSO/)

# Explanation
Each folder contain a main matlab code named "Phasex.mat" to run. The rest .mat files are the written and used funtions or saved nets.
